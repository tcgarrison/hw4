# Homework Assignment #4
## KIEI-924 Winter 2018

### Guidelines for submission

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file (DO NOT clone/"open in desktop").
2. Unzip the ZIP file – this will result in a folder called `hw4-master`.
3. Rename the `hw4-master` folder to `hw4`.
4. Move the `hw4` folder to the top-level of your `code` folder. DO NOT place inside your _username.github.io_ folder or any other subfolders of your `code` folder.
5. Using the GitHub Desktop app, create a new repository (File -> New Repository). The name should be `hw4` and the local path should be your code folder – i.e. `/Users/<your username>/code` (Mac) or `\code` (Windows).
6. Install all necessary dependencies using the `yarn` command. Start the React development server using the `yarn start` command.
7. Complete the homework per the instructions in the `src/App.js` file.
8. Commit and publish your `hw4` repository to your GitHub account. The finished product should live at `https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/hw4`.
